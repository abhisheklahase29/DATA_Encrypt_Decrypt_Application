# 1. INTRODUCTION
Data security is a major issue which we are facing today in this digital world of 
communication. As we know that today hackers are almost at every corner in 
search of our useful data which can be hacked by them for their different 
purposes. Even the risk gets doubled when come to the data of any country's 
government.
Data protection can be accomplished by changing the original data by any 
means to some other unuseful data so that if someone gets that data by means of 
hacking then also it must remain in unuseful bits of data for that person. This 
process can be achieved by Encrypting that data by some means of algorithms 
which are known to the sender and on the other side the similar Decryption 
algorithms must be known to only the desired receiver so that it can convert that 
encrypted data back to the user understandable form.
Today as it is a need to develop such kind of applications which performs the 
specified task but along with it should be very much user friendly so that no 
special skills need to be required to learn in order to use that application or 
project.
This is a Java based project with inbuilt hard disk storage unit as a database. 
This report contains in depth demonstration of Data Encryption and Decryption 
system along with its working architecture which contains brief introduction, 
features, prototype, information about other similar projects, outputs, source 
code and at last references.
 
# 1.1. Objective

 This project will meet the following objectives:
 To explore and implement an encryption and digital signature program to use 
with the aim of providing the user with a basic knowledge of the fundamental 
techniques of encryption and digital signature.
 To provide the user with authentication, integrity, confidentiality and nonrepudiation of the data.
 To provide the user with an enhanced security of their data.
 To provide the user with a way to easily and conveniently protect the data.
 User friendly interface.
# 1.2. Scope 
• The scope of this project includes the following features:
• Easy and convenient for encryption.
• The program works for variable size of grid.
• All the outliers can be detected by the program in a two phase manner.
• The performance of the software package depends on the volume of data i.e. the 
number of objects in the dataset.
• The inputs in terms of file size in a dataset have to be entered manually.
• Efficient in terms of memory utilization.
• Time saving.
# 1.3. Use of the project 
Data Encryption helps to you protect the privacy of your email messages, 
documents and sensitive files. Encryption works with both - text information 

and files. We just have to select what we want to encrypt, and encryption and 
decryption helps us keep documents, private information and files in a 
confidential way. Encryption is also used to ensure the confidentiality of the file 
and documents from the adversary so that the files and documents are remained 
in a secure way.
Data encryption is also used to provide the security and safety of the files and 
other important documents from the opponent so that while sending the files or 
documents nobody else other than the recipient can see it.
This project has the similar mechanism to provide the security and safety of the 
files by using a public key algorithm named DSA.
Today’s the prominence of internet day to day increased a lot and the transfers 
of files and confidential information over the internet demands the security and 
safety of the files and this can be accomplished by using encryption and 
decryption. In current scenario, encryption and decryption are most widely used 
in every field like defense, banking,
# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
 #2.1 General 
It is the process of converting ordinary information (called plain text) into 
unintelligible text (called cipher text). Decryption is the reverse of words, 
in other words, moving from the unintelligible cipher text back to plain 
text. A cipher is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the 
reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both 
by the algorithm and in each instance by a "key". This is a secret (ideally 
known only to the communicants), usually a short string of characters, 
which is needed to decrypt the cipher text.
# 2.2 Historical Background
Encryption is a process of converting messages, information, or data into a 
form unreadable by anyone except the intended recipient.
Encrypted data must be deciphered, or decrypted, before it can be read by 
the recipient. The root of the word encryption—crypt—comes from the 
Greek word kryptos, meaning hidden or secret. In its earliest form, people 
have been attempting to conceal certain information that they wanted to 
keep to their own possession by substituting parts of the information with 
symbols, numbers and pictures, this paper highlights in chronology the 
history of Cryptography throughout centuries. For different reason, 
humans have been interested in protecting their messages. Threats to 
computer and network security increase with each passing day and come 
from a growing number of sources. 
#3. Design and Implementation
3.1 Software and Hardware Requirements
Java, JDK, Android SDK, 
Android Mobile Device, Android studio

# 4.1 Existing Limitation of project
The perspective of data security, which has always been an important 
aspect of quality of service, Cloud Computing inevitably, poses new 
challenging security threats for number of reasons.
Encryption of data/text was previously done using hash and cryptography 
algorithms, which is written in binary form. Such encryption techniques 
are visible in a specific form and the intruder who is aware of binary text 
formats can easily read the text.
In those times it provided a lot of security but as technology progressed 
many hackers also came into existence and it could not provide security up 
to that extent. 
4.2Proposed system with features:
 In this project we used many technique to ensure the safety of the project, 
As well as the In this project we used many techniques to encrypt and 
make the data translated to random gibberish, We used ASCII Value 
format crypt-graphic techniques to encrypt the data and the data/text being 
encrypted in gibberish which not readable by ideal human being. Thus we 
can use the copied gibberish to create the same text we encrypted which 
make it reliable for user, And it is easy to use.
the text/data we encrypted can be transfer without any damage to the 
data and can be decrypted by the next person. 
 

# CONCLUSION: 
Due to this project we have gained a lot of knowledge about encryption and decryption of 
data, the time we spend on this project makes a big difference in what we used to know
about security of data of user.
We learn so much in this project which can be really helpful for us in the rest of our life
we can use our project to keep data safe in some more time we can upgrade security of the 
project and can also add wireless encrypted data transfer.
The management we learn during our project creation will help us throughout our life.
Moreover, decision making was also what we got.
